                      <p>
                      In this 16 hours learn the opening moves of Watsu (usually introduced in the Watsu Round). 
                      Learn how the getting lighter of the one in your arms each time they breathe in, engages 
                      your own breathing from a deep level, and establishes the rhythm of the moves and stretches to come. 
                      Learn how floating someone at your heart draws you into a continuum, a moving as water, and a profound stillness. 
                      View the moves of Basic Watsu below.

                      Having learned to adapt the established form to whoever you have in your arms, 
                      your body is ready to be wherever someone arrives in a Free Flow. 
                      Rolls are taught in this class, and how to be wherever someone comes out of one. 
                      Besides opening the door to Free Flow, this class introduces the powerful moves 
                      that Watsu began with when Harold took the stretches of Zen Shiatsu into the pool.

                    Watsu® (Water Shiatsu) is the first form of Aquatic Bodywork. 
                    It began in 1980 in the warm pool at Harbin Hot Springs when 
                    Harold Dull started floating people while applying the stretches 
                    and principles of the Zen Shiatsu he had studied in Japan.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the years since, with the help of countless others in classes, 
                      clinics and spas around the world, Watsu has evolved into whatmany 
                      consider the most profound developmentin bodywork in our time. While 
                      other modalities are based on touch,

                     </p>
                    <p>the holding that working in water necessitates, brings the receiver to a new level of connection and trust.</p>
                    <p>This, combined with the therapeutic benefits of warm water and the greater 
                      freedom of movement it encourages, creates a modality that can affect every level of our being.</p>
                      <p>Watsu® is a registered service mark of Harold Dull.
                        (Extract of http://www.watsu.com/, the official website of the Worldwide Aquatic Bodywork Association)</p>
                        <p>Besides taking place in a warm water environment, Watsu sessions focus around being held, rocked and moved by 
                          an experienced Watsu practitioner. As you relax, your breathing becomes noticeably calmer, deeper and slower. 
                          The comforting sensation of warmth and weightlessness makes all unnecessary muscular activity stop. You just 
                          let go – which from a therapeutic point of view, is an ideal way to rid the body of toxins, tensions and blockages.</p>
                          <p>Humans move differently in water and on land. In water, our movements are more complete and flowing. In an aquatic setting, 
                            pressure on the body is evenly distributed, because water is buoyant and supports evenly in all directions. This has a relaxing effect, 
                            making possible the characteristic Watsu moves and stretches which would be unthinkable on land. The movements are coordinated to match 
                            the rhythm of breathing.

                         </p>
                         <p>Watsu is not a solo activity – like dancing, you do it with a partner. 
                           Giving Watsu is just as important as receiving it. That is why, during training, 
                           roles are constantly switched and participants discover that giving Watsu really 
                           is just as pleasurable as receiving it. The movements are adapted and rhythmically 
                           coordinated to your partner’s breathing. The buoyant water is the essential third party in the action, 
                           constantly supporting and sustaining you and your partner. Without the water there would be no Watsu.</p>

                           <p>The established form of Watsu is taught in the 50 hour intensives, Watsu 1 and 2. It has been developed over the last thirty years 
                             by Harold Dull with the help of instructors who have been applying and fine tuning it in their practice and classes around the world.</p>
