            Our mission at SHA, is that you enjoy and have an unforgettable
            stay, as well as to produce a positive, substantial and lasting
            change in your health and wellness, so that you feel a state of
            complete balance. Healthy nutrition, the most effective and proven
            natural therapies and the latest advances in scientific medicine,
            are our most valuable tools to achieve the best results in the
            shortest possible time.
            <br />
            <br />
            In SHA we have over 250 professionals from 35 different
            nationalities, including more than thirty doctors and
            internationally renowned experts with a common goal to help you
            achieve the best version of yourself. The healthy food we offer in
            SHA is fully balanced. It is primarily based on cereals and pasta,
            seeds, legumes, vegetables and seasonal fruits, always using organic
            and ecological products. We do serve fresh fish but no meat, eggs or
            dairy products (we do serve substitutes of milk such as almond or
            rice milk, much more digestive and healthy for our body). We do not
            serve coffee (is replaced by cereal coffee or natural teas) or
            sugary drinks, not recommended for our health.
