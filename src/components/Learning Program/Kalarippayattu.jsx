                    kalarippayatta, kalaripayatt and many others depending on the dialect and 
                    romanisation system used. It includes strikes, kicks, grappling, preset forms, 
                    weaponry and healing methods.Regional variants are classified according to 
                    geographical position in Kerala; these are the northern style, the southern 
                    style and the central style. Northern kalari payat is based on the principle 
                    of hard technique, while the southern style primarily follows the soft techniques, 
                    even though both systems make use of internal and external concepts.                  </p>
