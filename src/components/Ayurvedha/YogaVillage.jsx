                                           <strong> Ayurveda</strong> considered by many scholars to be the oldest healing science, Ayurveda is a holistic approach to health that is designed to help people live long, healthy, and well-balanced lives. The term Ayurveda is taken from the Sanskrit words ayus, meaning life or lifespan, and veda, meaning knowledge. It has been practiced in India for at least 5,000 years and has recently become popular in Western cultures. The basic principle of Ayurveda is to prevent and treat illness by maintaining balance in the body, mind, and consciousness through proper drinking, diet, and lifestyle, as well as herbal remedies.

                                   <p>Special Monsoon Panchakarma with Devas Rejuvenation
                                            
                                       <p>Ayurveda is a 5000 year old system of holistic healing that takes into account the mind, the body, the senses and the soul. It is the work of harmonizing the body through the in-depth knowledge and understanding of nature and the inner self, that generates healing on all levels. Ayurveda originates in India and was developed by ancient Ayurvedic Acharyas who referred to it as “The Science of Life”.</p></p>

                                        <p>According to Ayurveda, monsoon season is the best season for rejuvenation therapies that strengthen the body, for the atmosphere is dust-free, humid and cool. Moreover, the body is most receptive to herbal oils and therapies during the monsoon, as this is when its pores are open to their maximum extent. These favorable conditions accelerate healing and restore the body’s vitality, health and balance.</p>
                                        <p>Ayurveda has selectively recognized monsoon season as the best time for receiving PanchakarmaRejuvenation therapies. Panchakarma is a curative treatment that deeply cleanses and detoxifies the body without damaging the tissues. It reinforces the immune system and leaves the body healthier, stronger and free from chronic ailments.</p>
                                        <p>The Panchakarma Rejuvenation treatment program is a unique opportunity to cleanse and rejuvenate both physically and mentally in a pure, spiritual and yogic environment. One should approach the program with the desire to retreat from normal life and use the time to reconnect to body, mind and soul.</p>
                                        <p>Ayurveda Yoga Villa offers a 21 day Special Monsoon Panchakarma Rejuvenation program with the last 9 days of the rejuvenation period at the Udayagiri Mountain Retreat. The overall outlook and concept of the program is to help you align with your higher Self through the wisdom of your body, and to recognize this connection when you achieve it. Once you align in this way, you are forever empowered. Your purpose becomes clear, you are on track, and your life begins to embrace a flow of grace and ease.</p>
